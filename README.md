# Stronglifts5x5
My first personal project. The code isn't particularly clean, organized, or efficient. But I'm still proud of it.

This program is essentially a personal weight tracker that follows the popular strength training routine, Stronglifts 5x5. It automatically calculates your progression, your next workout, and your need to deload if necessary. All output is to the command line; it does save files to a local text file and if you input the same username, it parses the text file to retrieve saved information.

I originally wrote it in one large file (Stronglifts Backup.cpp), but I think I decided to split it up into multiple different .cpp and .h files to make it a lot cleaner. However, I'm not sure if this runs corrently and I'm not to keen to mess around with this.

Regardless, I figured I'd upload it to reference it if I ever needed to, or mainly to prove to recruiters that I indeed wrote this program called Stronglifts5x5. This was originally written in January 2015.
